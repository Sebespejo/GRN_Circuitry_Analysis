# Gene Regulatory Networks & simple patterning phenotypes: circuit analysis
Analysis of GRN circuitrie

### Author 
Sebastian Espejo

### Goals
The purpose of this project is to analyze a large population of computational gene regulatory networks (GRNs) able to produce a 
simple pattern of expression.
